# Project-2

There wasn't many challenges in this project just figuring out how each method would be implemented and used. The parsing through the
file was a little different this time but it was easier to do because there was no whitespace at the beginning

For this project I started with the MesoInherit to actually understand what it wanted for the average. Calculating the average ascii of a 
string is easy because if you set an int to the value of a char it automatically casts the char using its ascii value. So you jut find value
fo rall of the characcters and divide by 4. Then put the three average values in an array.

Next posAvg the first letter of each station was checked to see if it matched the ascii value of the average from the MesoInherit classs.
This was easy, you just had to iterate through the names of the stations. 

This class puts all of the station ids into an array list and finds the index of the users station by iterating over the array list. the 
other station tha give th esame position average are jut N bove and N below the current station.
